1. motivation of this code
This code is for calculating the dynamical electromagnetic fields in Heavy-ion Collisions with Au+Au 200Gev, 
by solving the Maxwell equation under the static QGP background with space-time dependent electric conductivity.
The reader can get the evolution of electric and magnetic fields on a given point, and can also get the distribution 
function of the electric and magnetic fields at any time. 

2. how to run this code

bash local_running.sh

or use the following commands
make 
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16
./eb.out

#where the above the number 16 is the number of threads of CPU, it can be changed up to your CPU. 
#you need firstly install the gcc (or g++) and openmp.

3. how to change the parameters
The corresponding parameters are defined in file src/parameter.h 
the most important points on the model of the electric conductivity:
#define Model   212 //numberofmodel //firt 1(2)--Bjorken(Hubble) model, second 0(1 or 2) ---Homogenous(spehere or Gauss) case, third 1(2)---vacuum(turn-on) case //000 and 001 is for constant case
#define Medium_open 2 //1(2) the medium is corresponding to vacuum (turn-on)

When you change the electric conductivity model, you need to be careful of these two definitions.  
The Medium_open number is the same as the last number in the above Model except for Model=000 and 001.

4. About the results
    4.1 The units of the resulted electric and magnetic fields are of the fm^(-2). 

    4.2 the dataframe is 

    A. to mangetic field
    t, x, y, z, B^i_external, B^i_total
    Where i=x, y, z. B^i_external is the magnetic field of the external field generated by the Heavy-ions. 
    B^i_total is summed by the external magnetic field and induced mangetic field.

    B. to electric field 
    t, x, y, z, E^i_external, E^i_total
    Where i=x, y, z. E^i_external is the electric field of the external field generated by the Heavy-ions. 
    E^i_total is summed by the external electric field and induced electric field.
